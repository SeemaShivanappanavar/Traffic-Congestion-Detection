# 🚗 Real-Time Traffic Density Estimation with YOLOv8

![Traffic Congestion Sample](./images/image1.png)


# 🔍 Overview

This project harnesses the combined power of YOLOv8n, YOLOv10n, and YOLOv12n's real-time detection capabilities to address Traffic Density Estimation in images, a vital aspect of urban traffic management systems. The primary goal is to accurately count and classify vehicles within designated areas in static images, enabling precise evaluation of traffic flow conditions at specific times.

# 🎯 Objectives

The pivotal milestones achieved in our project include:
  * Detect and classify vehicles in traffic images using trained YOLOv8n, YOLOv10n, and YOLOv12n models.
  * Categorize traffic scenes into three congestion levels: heavy, medium, and light based on vehicle count and spatial distribution.
  * Calculate key traffic density metrics, such as the number of vehicles detected per image, to provide quantitative insights into traffic flow.
